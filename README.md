Hi! this is a personal project for show my arts with minimalist style. :relieved:
I am also an illustrator, graduated in graphic and multimedia production, I like the style of sketch and black and white, but make no mistake, I also know how to put colors;)
I am a tattoo artist and body piercing apprentice.

I developed this project with Gatsby:

- React Js
- SASS
- GraphQL
- No CSS Frameworks.
- Framer Motion

I really hope you enjoy it! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
